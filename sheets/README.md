# sheets app

This app is being adapted from the old pytohn-spreadsheet project to a django app.

When a user goes to view a sheet, a process will be launched that will hold a persistant version of the sheet and handle manipulating the sheet, just as was done in the origin program.

## questions

Where is the actual sheet data stored
